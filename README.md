🍽️ Cuisine Intelligence Engine
End-to-End Machine Learning Project for Restaurant Cuisine Classification

An industry-grade ML system that classifies restaurant cuisines using structured data, probabilistic inference, and a production-ready pipeline with a modern web interface.

🎯 Business Problem Statement

Food discovery platforms and restaurant aggregators often struggle to accurately tag cuisines, especially when restaurants serve multiple cuisines.

⚙️ Tech Stack

Language : Python

ML Framework : Scikit-learn

Algorithm : Random Forest Classifier

Backend : Flask

Frontend : HTML, Bootstrap 5

Serialization  : Dill

Version Control  : Git

📊 Model Evaluation
Metrics Used

Accuracy

Precision, Recall, F1-score

Top-3 Accuracy (Business-relevant)

Key Insight

Standard accuracy appears low (~29%), but:

Top-3 accuracy exceeds 60%, which aligns with how real restaurant platforms function (multiple cuisines per restaurant).

This demonstrates strong ranking ability, which is more valuable than exact classification.

🖥️ Web Application

The project includes a modern, dark-themed UI that allows users to:

Input restaurant details

Receive Top-3 cuisine predictions
